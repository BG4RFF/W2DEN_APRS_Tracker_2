# W2DEN_APRS_Tracker_2
Tracker with a menu
This version will include a menu to allow users to change some of the 'default' data. A new version 'thread' was created so the original Tracker did not change. this will allow other development without the menu system included.
Who knows, where this is going!
UPDATE 8/5/15: For all practical purposes the software is complete. There will be some code refinements, the menu system is 'brute force' coding and needs some sophisitcation.
Documentaion will be brought up to speed on the N4SER.org site. 
NOTE: libraries included with the Arduino IDE and/or the Tensyduino IDE are NOT captured here. They will be documented as time allows.
